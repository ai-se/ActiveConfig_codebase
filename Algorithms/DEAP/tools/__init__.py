"""The :mod:`~DEAP.tools` module contains the operators for evolutionary
algorithms. They are used to modify, select and move the individuals in their
environment. The set of operators it contains are readily usable in the
:class:`~DEAP.base.Toolbox`. In addition to the basic operators this module
also contains utility tools to enhance the basic algorithms with
:class:`Statistics`, :class:`HallOfFame`, :class:`Checkpoint`, and
:class:`History`.
