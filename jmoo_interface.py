Quick Notes
------------

The Main Interface of JMOO.  Run this python script from the commmand line with or without command line arguments.

- The Core behind JMOO is to perform 'tests' and then prepare 'reports' about those tests.
- - A 'test' is a collection of problems and algorithms.  Each algorithm is tested against each problem.

- To define tests (and many other properties), please see jmoo_properties.py
- To define reports, see below in this python script.
